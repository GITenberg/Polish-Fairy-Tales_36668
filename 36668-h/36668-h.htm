<p class="h2">TALES FROM POLAND</p>

<p>These are selections from a large collection made by
A. J. Glinski, printed at Wilna in 1862. These
fairy tales come from a far past and may even date
from primitive Aryan times. They represent the folklore
current among the peasantry of the Eastern provinces of
Poland, and also in those provinces usually known as
White Russia.</p>

<p>They were set down by Glinski just as they were related
to him by the peasants.</p>

<p>In the translation it was of course necessary to shorten
them considerably; the continual repetition&mdash;however
quaint and fascinating in the original&mdash;cannot easily be
reproduced. Portions, too, are often told in rhyme, or in a
species of rhyming prose that we associate with the ancient
ballad. The obvious likenesses between these and the folklore
of Germany, the Celtic nations, or to the Indian fairy-tales,
will strike every reader.</p>

<h2>THE FROG PRINCESS</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="159" height="150" alt="T" />

<b>HERE</b> was once a king, who was very old; but he had three grown-up sons. So he
called them to him, and said:</p>

<p>"My dear sons, I am very old, and the
cares of government press heavily upon me. I must
therefore give them over to one of you. But as it is the
law among us, that no unmarried prince may be King, I
wish you all to get married, and whoever chooses the best
wife shall be my successor."</p>

<p>So they determined each to go a different way, and settled
<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
it thus. They went to the top of a very high tower, and
each one at a given signal shot an arrow in a different
direction to the others. Wherever their arrows fell they
were to go in search of their future wives.</p>

<p>The eldest prince's arrow fell on a palace in the city,
where lived a senator, who had a beautiful daughter; so he
went there, and married her.</p>

<p>The second prince's arrow struck upon a country-house,
where a very pretty young lady, the daughter of a rich
gentleman, was sitting; so he went there, and proposed to
her, and they were married.</p>

<p>But the youngest prince's arrow shot through a green
wood, and fell into a lake. He saw his arrow floating
among the reeds, and a frog sitting thereon, looking fixedly
at him.</p>

<p>But the marshy ground was so unsafe that he could
not venture upon it; so he sat down in despair.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, prince?" asked the frog.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Why, I cannot reach that arrow
on which you are sitting."</p>

<p>"Take me for your wife, and I will give it to you."</p>

<p>"But how can you be my wife, little frog?"</p>

<p>"That is just what has got to be. You know that you
shot your arrow from the tower, thinking that where it fell,
you would find a loving wife; so you will have her in me."</p>

<p>"You are very wise, I see, little frog. But tell me, how<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
can I marry you, or introduce you to my father? And what
will the world say?"</p>

<p>"Take me home with you, and let nobody see me. Tell
them that you have married an Eastern lady, who must not
be seen by any man, except her husband, nor even by another
woman."</p>

<p>The prince considered a little. The arrow had now
floated to the margin of the lake; he took the arrow from
the little frog, put her in his pocket, carried her home, and
then went to bed, sighing very deeply.</p>

<p>Next morning the king was told that all his sons had got
married; so he called them all together, and said:</p>

<p>"Well children, are you all pleased with your wives?"</p>

<p>"Very pleased indeed, father and king."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see who has chosen best. Let each of
my daughters-in-law weave me a carpet by to-morrow,
and the one whose carpet is the most beautiful shall be
queen."</p>

<p>The elder princes hastened at once to their ladies; but
the youngest, when he reached home, was in despair.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, prince?" asked the frog.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? My father has ordered that each
of his daughters-in-law shall weave him a carpet, and the
one whose carpet proves the most beautiful shall be first in
rank. My brothers' wives are most likely working at their
looms already. But you, little frog, although you can give<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
back an arrow, and talk like a human being, will not be
able to weave a carpet, as far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," she said; "go to sleep, and before
you wake the carpet shall be ready."</p>

<p>So he lay down, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>But the little frog stood on her hind-legs in the window
and sang:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ye breezes that blow, ye winds that sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come hither on airy wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all of you straight to my dwelling hie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And various treasures bring.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Two fleeces I crave of the finest wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And of the loveliest flowers a basketful;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From the depths of the ocean bring sands of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And pearl-drops of lustre manifold;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That so I may fashion a carpet bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Adorned with fair flow'rets and gems of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And weave it in one short day and night,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">When my true love's hands must the treasure hold."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a gentle murmur of the breezes, and from the<br />
sunbeams descended seven lovely maidens, who floated into
the room, carrying baskets of various coloured wools, pearls,
and flowers. They curtsied deeply to the little frog, and
in a few minutes they wove a wonderfully beautiful carpet;
then they curtsied again, and flew away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wives of the other princes bought the
most beautifully coloured wools, and the best designs they
could find, and worked hard at their looms all the next
day.<span class="pagenum">[5]</span></p>

<p>Then all the princes came before the king, and spread
out their carpets before him.</p>

<p>The king looked at the first and the second; but when
he came to the third, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That's the carpet for me! I give the first place to
my youngest son's wife; but there must be another trial
yet."</p>

<p>And he ordered that each of his daughters-in-law should
make him a cake next day; and the husband of the one
whose cake proved the best should be his successor.</p>

<p>The youngest prince came back to his frog wife; he
looked very thoughtful, and sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, prince?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My father demands another proof of skill; and I am
not so sure that we shall succeed so well as before; for
how can you bake a cake?"</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," she said: "Lie down, and sleep;
and when you wake you will be in a happier frame of
mind."</p>

<p>The prince went to sleep; and the frog sprang up to
the window, and sang:</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ye breezes that blow, ye winds that sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come hither on airy wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all of you straight to my dwelling hie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These various gifts to bring.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From the sunbeams bright<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Bring me heat and light;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
<span class="i6">And soft waters distil<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From the pure flowing rill.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">From the flowers of the field<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Five full measures of grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That so I may bake<br /></span>
<span class="i6">In the night-time a cake,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For my true love's sake."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The winds began to rise, and the seven beautiful maidens
floated down into the room, carrying baskets, with flour,
water, sweetmeats, and all sorts of dainties. They curtsied
to the little frog, and got the cake ready in a few minutes;
curtsied again, and flew away.</p>

<p>The next day the three princes brought their cakes to
the king. They were all very good; but when he tasted
the one made by his youngest son's wife, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That is the cake for me! light, floury, white, and
delicious! I see, my son, you have made the best choice;
but we must wait a little longer."</p>

<p>The two elder sons went away much depressed; but the
youngest greatly elated. When he reached home he took up
his little frog, stroked and kissed her, and said:</p>

<p>"Tell me, my love, how it was that you, being only a little
frog, could weave such a beautiful carpet, or make such a
delicious cake?"</p>

<p>"Because, my prince, I am not what I seem. I am a<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
princess, and my mother is the renowned Queen of Light, and
a great enchantress. But she has many enemies, who, as
they could not injure her, were always seeking to destroy me.
To conceal me from them she was obliged to turn me into
a frog; and for seven years I have been forced to stay in the
marsh where you found me. But under this frog-skin I am
really more beautiful than you can imagine; yet until my
mother has conquered all her enemies I must wear this disguise;
after that takes place you shall see me as I really am."</p>

<p>While they were talking two courtiers entered, with the
king's orders to the young prince, to come to a banquet at
the king's palace, and bring his wife with him, as his brothers
were doing by theirs.</p>

<p>He knew not what to do; but the little frog said:</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, my prince. Go to your father alone;
and when he asks for me, it will begin to rain. You must
then say that your wife will follow you; but she is now
bathing in May-dew. When it lightens say that I am
dressing; and when it thunders, that I am coming."</p>

<p>The prince, trusting to her word, set out for the palace;
and the frog jumped up to the window, and standing on
her hind-legs, began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ye breezes that blow, ye winds that sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come hither on airy wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all of you straight to my dwelling hie,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These several gifts to bring.<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><span class="pagenum">[8]</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">My beauty of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And my bright youth once more;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All my dresses so fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And my jewels so rare;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And let me delight<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My dear love by the sight."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the seven beautiful damsels, who were the handmaidens
of the princess&mdash;when she lived with her mother&mdash;floated
on the sunbeams into the room. They curtsied,
walked three times round her, and pronounced some magical
words.</p>

<p>Then the frog-skin fell off her, and she stood among
them a miracle of beauty, and the lovely princess she was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prince, her husband, had arrived at the
royal banquet-hall, which was already full of guests. The
old king welcomed him warmly, and asked him:</p>

<p>"Where is your wife, my son?"</p>

<p>Then a light rain began to fall, and the prince said:</p>

<p>"She will not be long; she is now bathing herself in
May-dew."</p>

<p>Then came a flash of lightning, which illuminated all
the palace, and he said:</p>

<p>"She is now adorning herself."</p>

<p>But when it thundered, he ran to the door exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Here she is!"</p>

<p>And the lovely princess came in, seeming to bring the
sunshine with her. They all stood amazed at her beauty.<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
The king could not contain his delight; and she seemed
to him all the more beautiful, because he thought her the
very image of his long-deceased queen. The prince himself
was no less astonished and overjoyed to find such loveliness
in her, whom he had only as yet seen in the shape of a
little frog.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my son," said the king, "why you did
not let me know what a fortunate choice you had
made?"</p>

<p>The prince told him everything in a whisper; and the
king said:</p>

<p>"Go home then, my son, at once, and pick up that
frog-skin of hers; throw it in the fire, and come back here
as fast as you can. Then she will have to remain just
as she is now."</p>

<p>The prince did as his father told him, went home, and
threw the frog-skin into the fire, where it was at once
consumed.</p>

<p>But things did not turn out as they expected; for the
lovely princess, on coming home, sought for her frog-skin,
and not finding it, began to cry bitterly. When the prince
confessed the truth, she shrieked aloud, and taking out a
green poppy-head, threw it at him. He went to sleep at
once; but she sprang up to the window, sang her songs
to the winds; upon which she was changed into a duck,
and flew away.<span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>The prince woke up in the morning, and grieved sadly,
when he found his beautiful princess gone.</p>

<p>Then he got on horseback, and set out to find her,
inquiring everywhere for the kingdom of the Queen of Light&mdash;his
princess's mother&mdash;to whom he supposed she must
have fled.</p>

<p>He rode on for a very, very long time, till one day he
came into a wide plain, all covered with poppies in full flower,
the odour of which so overpowered him, that he could scarce
keep upright in his saddle. Then he saw a queer little house,
supported on four crooked legs. There was no door to the
house; but knowing what he ought to do, he said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Little house, move<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On your crooked legs free;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turn your back to the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And your front door to me."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The hut with the crooked legs made a creaking noise,
and turned round, with its door towards the prince.
He went straight in, and found an old fury, whose name
was Jandza, <img src="images/jandza.jpg" alt="Jandza" width="25" />
inside; she was spinning from a distaff,
and singing.</p>

<p>[<img src="images/jandza.jpg" alt="Jandza" width="25" />]

<i>Jandza</i> pronounced Yen-jar.</p>

<p>"How are you, prince?" she said, "what brings
you here?"</p>

<p>So the prince told her, and she said:</p>

<p>"You have done wisely to tell me the truth. I know your
bride, the beautiful daughter of the Queen of Light; she flies
<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>to my house daily, in the shape of a duck, and this is where
she sits. Hide yourself under the table, and watch your
opportunity to lay hold of her. Hold her fast, whatever
shapes she assumes; when she is tired she will turn into a
spindle; you must then break the spindle in two, and you
will find that which you are seeking."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 591px;">

</a>
<a name="THE_LITTLE_HOUSE_TURNS"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">THE LITTLE HOUSE TURNS</p>

<p>Presently the duck flew in, sat down beside the old fury,
and began to preen her feathers with her beak. The prince
seized her by the wing. The duck quacked, fluttered, and
struggled to get loose. But seeing this was useless she
changed herself into a pigeon, then into a hawk, and then
into a serpent, which so frightened the prince, that he let her
go; on which she became a duck again, quacked aloud, and
flew out of the window.</p>

<p>The prince saw his mistake, and the old woman cried
aloud:</p>

<p>"What have you done, you careless fellow! you have
frightened her away from me for ever. But as she is your
bride, I must find some other way to help you. Take this
ball of thread, throw it before you, and wherever it goes follow
after it; you will then come to my sister's house, and she will
tell you what to do next."</p>

<p>So the prince went on day and night, following the ball of
thread, till he came to another queer little house, like the first,
to which he said the same rhyme, and going in, found the
second old fury, and told her his story.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>"Hide under the bench," she exclaimed; "your bride
is just coming in."</p>

<p>The duck flew in, as before, and the prince caught her
by the wing; she quacked, and tried to get away. Then
she changed herself into a turkey, then into a dog, then
into a cat, then into an eel, so that she slipped through
his hands, and glided out of the window.</p>

<p>The prince was in despair; but the old woman gave
him another ball of thread, and he again followed it,
determining not to let the princess escape again so easily.
So going on after the thread, as it kept unwinding,
he came to a funny little house, like the two first,
and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Little house, move<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On your crooked legs free;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turn your back to the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And your front door to me."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The little house turned round, so that he could go in,
and he found a third old fury inside; much older than
her sisters, and having white hair. He told her his story,
and begged for help.</p>

<p>"Why did you go against the wishes of your clever
and sensible wife?" said the old woman. "You see she
knew better than you what her frog-skin was good for;
but you must needs be in such a hurry to display her
beauty, to gain the world's applause, that you have lost her;
and she was forced to fly away from you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">THE WAY HOME</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>The prince hid himself under the bench: the duck flew
in and sat at the old woman's feet; on which he caught
her by the wings.</p>

<p>She struggled hard; but she felt his strength was too
great for her to resist; so she turned herself into a spindle
at once. He broke it across his knee.... And lo! and
behold! instead of the two halves of the spindle he held
the hands of his beautiful princess, who looked at him
lovingly with her beautiful eyes, and smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>And she promised him that she would always remain
as she was then, for since her mother's enemies were all
dead she had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>They embraced each other, and went out of the old
fury's hut. Then the princess spoke some magical spells;
and in the twinkling of an eye there appeared a wonderful
bridge, reaching from where they stood hundreds of miles,
up to the very gallery of the palace, belonging to the prince's
father. It was all made of crystal, with golden hand-rails,
and diamond bosses upon them.</p>

<p>The princess spoke some more magical words, and a
golden coach appeared, drawn by eight horses, and a coachman,
and two tall footmen, all in golden liveries. And
there were four outriders on splendid horses, riding by the
side of the coach, and an equerry, riding in front, and
blowing a brazen trumpet. And a long procession of
followers, in splendid dresses, came after them.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>Then the prince and princess got into the golden coach,
and drove away, thus accompanied, along the crystal bridge,
till they reached home, when the old king came out to
meet them, and embraced them both tenderly. He appointed
the prince his successor; and such magnificent festivities
were held on the occasion, as never were seen or heard
of before.</p>

<h2>PRINCESS MIRANDA AND PRINCE HERO</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="158" height="150" alt="F" />

<b>AR</b> away, in the wide ocean there was once
a green island where lived the most beautiful
princess in the world, named Miranda. She
had lived there ever since her birth, and
was queen of the island. Nobody knew who were her
parents, or how she had come there. But she was not
alone; for there were twelve beautiful maidens, who had
grown up with her on the island, and were her ladies-in-waiting.</p>

<p>But a few strangers had visited the island, and spoken
of the princess's great beauty; and many more came in time,
and became her subjects, and built a magnificent city, in which
she had a splendid palace of white marble to live in.</p>

<p>And in course of time a great many young princes came to<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
woo her. But she did not care to marry any of them; and if
anyone persisted, and tried to compel her by force to be his
wife, she could turn him and all his soldiers into ice, by
merely fixing her eyes upon them.</p>

<p>One day the wicked Kosciey,
<img src="images/kosciey.jpg" alt="kosciey" height="10" width="26" />
the king of the Underground
realm, came out into the upper world, and began to gaze
all round it with his telescope. Various empires and kingdoms
passed in review before him; and at last he saw the green
island, and the rich city upon it; and the marble palace in
this city, and in this palace the twelve beautiful young ladies-of-honour,
and among them he beheld, lying on a rich couch
of swansdown, the Princess Miranda asleep. She slept like
an innocent child, but she was dreaming of a young knight,
wearing a golden helmet, on a gallant steed, and carrying an
invisible mace, that fought of itself; ... and she loved
him better than life.</p>

<p>[<img src="images/kosciey.jpg" alt="kosciey" height="10" width="26" />]
<i>Kosciey</i> pronounced K&oacute;sh-che-eh, literally "Boney."</p>

<p>Kosciey looked at her; he was delighted with her beauty;
he struck the earth three times, and stood upon the green
island.</p>

<p>Princess Miranda called together her brave army, and led
them into the field, to fight the wicked Kosciey. But he,
blowing on them with his poisonous breath, sent them all fast
asleep, and he was just going to lay hands upon the princess,
when she, throwing a glance of scorn at him, changed him
into a lump of ice, and fled to her capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[17]</span></p><p>Kosciey did not long remain ice. So soon as the princess
was away, he freed himself from the power of her glance, and
regaining his usual form, followed her to her city. Then he
sent all the inhabitants of the island to sleep, and among
them the princess's twelve faithful damsels.</p>

<p>She was the only one whom he could not injure; but
being afraid of her glances, he surrounded the castle&mdash;which
stood upon a high hill&mdash;with an iron rampart, and placed a
dragon with twelve heads on guard before the gate, and
waited for the princess to give herself up of her own accord.</p>

<p>The days passed by, then weeks, then months, while her
kingdom became a desert; all her people were asleep, and her
faithful soldiers also lay sleeping on the open fields, their
steel armour all rusted, and wild plants were growing over
them undisturbed. Her twelve maidens were all asleep in
different rooms of the palace, just where they happened to be
at the time; and she herself, all alone, kept walking sadly to
and fro in a little room up in a tower, where she had taken
refuge&mdash;wringing her white hands, weeping, and her bosom
heaving with sighs.</p>

<p>Around her all were silent, as though dead; only every
now and then, Kosciey, not daring to encounter her
angry glance, knocked at the door asking her to surrender,
promising to make her queen of his Underground realm.
But it was all of no use; the princess was silent, and
only threatened him with her looks.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>But grieving in her lonely prison Princess Miranda could
not forget the lover of whom she had been dreaming;
she saw him just as he had appeared to her in her
dream.</p>

<p>And she looked up with her blue eyes to heaven, and
seeing a cloud floating by, she said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O cloud! through the bright sky flying!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stay, and hearken my piteous sighing!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In my sorrow I call upon thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where is my loved one? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where do his footsteps stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And does he now think of me?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"I know not," the cloud replied. "Ask the wind."</p>

<p>And she looked out into the wide plain, and seeing
how the wind was blowing freely, she said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O wind! o'er the wide world flying!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do thou pity my grief and crying!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Have pity on me!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where is my loved one? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where do his footsteps stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And does he now think of me?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Ask the stars," the wind replied; "they know more
than I do."</p>

<p>So she cried to the stars:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"O stars! with your bright beams glowing!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Look down on my tears fast flowing!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Have pity, have pity on me!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where is my loved one? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! where do his footsteps stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And does he now think of me?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>

<p>"Ask the moon," said the stars; "who being nearer to
the earth, knows more of what happens there than we
do."</p>

<p>So she said to the moon:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Bright moon, as your watch you keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the starry skies, o'er this land of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Look down now, and pity me!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh! where is my loved one? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where? where do his footsteps stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And does he now think of me?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"I know nothing about your loved one, princess," replied
the moon; "but here comes the sun, who will surely be
able to tell you."</p>

<p>And the sun rose up in the dawn, and at noontide stood
just over the princess's tower, and she said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Thou soul of the world! bright sun!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Look on me, in this prison undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Have pity on me!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh! where is my loved one? say!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Through what lands do his footsteps stray?<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And does he now think of me?"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Princess Miranda," said the sun; "dry your tears,
comfort your heart; your lover is hastening to you, from the
bottom of the deep sea, from under the coral reefs; he has
won the enchanted ring; when he puts it on his finger, his
army will increase by thousands, regiment after regiment,
with horse and foot; the drums are beating, the sabres
gleaming, the colours flying, the cannon roaring, they are<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
bearing down on the empire of Kosciey. But he cannot
conquer him by force of mortal weapons. I will teach him a
surer way; and there is good hope that he will be able to
deliver you from Kosciey, and save your country. I will
hasten to your prince. Farewell."</p>

<p>The sun stood over a wide country, beyond the deep seas,
beyond high mountains, where Prince Hero in a golden
helmet, on a gallant horse, was drawing up his army, and
preparing to march against Kosciey, the besieger of the fair
princess. He had seen her three times in a dream, and had
heard much about her, for her beauty was famous throughout
the world.</p>

<p>"Dismiss your army," said the sun. "No army can
conquer Kosciey, no bullet can reach him; you can only
free Princess Miranda by killing him, and how you are
to do it, you must learn from the old woman Jandza;
I can only tell you where you will find the horse, that
must carry you to her. Go hence towards the East; you
will come to a green meadow, in which there are three
oak trees; and among them you will find hidden in the
ground an iron door, with a brazen padlock; behind this
door you will find a battle charger, and a mace; the rest
you will learn afterwards; ... farewell!"</p>

<p>Prince Hero was most surprised; but he took off his
enchanted ring and threw it into the sea; with it all
his great army vanished directly into mist, leaving no<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
trace behind. He turned to the East and travelled onwards.</p>

<p>After three days he came to the green meadow, where
he found the three oak trees, and the iron door, as he had
been told. It opened upon a narrow, crooked stairway,
going downwards, leading into a deep dungeon, where he
found another iron door, closed by a heavy iron padlock.
Behind this he heard a horse neighing, so loudly that it
made the door fall to the ground, and at the same moment
eleven other doors flew open and there came out a war-horse,
which had been shut up there for ages by a
wizard.</p>

<p>The prince whistled to the horse; the horse tugged at
his fastenings, and broke twelve chains by which he had
been fettered. He had eyes like stars, flaming nostrils,
and a mane like a thunder-cloud; ... he was a horse
of horses, the wonder of the world.</p>

<p>"Prince Hero!" said the horse, "I have long waited for
such a rider as you, and I am ready to serve you for ever.
Mount on my back, take that mace in your hand, which you
see hanging to the saddle; you need not fight with it yourself,
for it will strike wherever you command it, and beat a whole
army. I know the way everywhere; tell me where you want
to go, and you will presently be there."</p>

<p>The prince told him everything; took the self-fighting
mace in his hand, and sprang on his back.<span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>The horse reared, snorted, spurned the ground, and they
flew over mountains and forests, higher than the flying
clouds, over rapid rivers, and deep seas; but when they
flew along the ground the charger's light feet never trampled
down a blade of grass, nor raised an atom of dust on
the sandy soil.</p>

<p>Before sunset Prince Hero had reached the primeval
forest in which the old woman Jandza lived.</p>

<p>He was amazed at the size and age of the mighty oaks,
pine trees and firs, where there reigned a perpetual twilight.
And there was absolute silence&mdash;not a leaf or a blade of grass
stirring; and no living thing, not so much as a bird, or the
hum of an insect; only amidst this grave-like stillness the
sound of his horse's hoofs.</p>

<p>The prince stopped before a little house, supported on
crooked legs, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Little house, move<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On your crooked legs free:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Turn your back to the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And your front to me."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The house turned round, with the door towards him;
the prince went in, and the old woman Jandza asked him:</p>

<p>"How did you get here, Prince Hero, where no living
soul has penetrated till now?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me; but welcome your guest politely."</p>

<p>So the old woman gave the prince food and drink, made<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
up a soft bed for him, to rest on after his journey, and
left him for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning he told her all, and what he had come
for.</p>

<p>"You have undertaken a great and splendid task, prince;
so I will tell you how to kill Kosciey. In the Ocean-Sea,
on the island of Everlasting Life, there is an old oak tree;
under this tree is buried a coffer bound with iron; in this
coffer is a hare; under the hare sits a grey duck; this
duck carries within her an egg; and in this egg is enclosed
the life of Kosciey. When you break the egg he will die
at once. Now good-bye, prince; and good luck go with
you; your horse will show you the way."</p>

<p>The prince got on horseback, and they soon left
the forest behind them, and came to the shore of the
ocean.</p>

<p>On the beach was a fisherman's net, and in the net
was a great fish, who when he saw the prince, cried out
piteously:</p>

<p>"Prince Hero! take me out of the net, and throw me
back into the sea; I will repay you!"</p>

<p>The prince took the fish out of the net, and threw it
into the sea; it splashed in the water, and vanished.</p>

<p>The prince looked over the sea, and saw the island in
the grey distance, far, far away; but how was he to get
there? He leaned upon his mace, deep in thought.<span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, prince?" asked the
horse.</p>

<p>"I am thinking how I am to get to the island, when
I cannot swim over that breadth of sea."</p>

<p>"Sit on my back, prince, and hold fast."</p>

<p>So the prince sat firm on the horse's back, and held
fast by the thick mane; a wind arose, and the sea was
somewhat rough; but rider and horse pushed on, through
the billows, and at last came to shore on the island of
Everlasting Life.</p>

<p>The prince took off his horse's bridle, and let him loose
to feed in a meadow of luxuriant grass, and walked on
quickly to a high hill, where grew the old oak tree. Taking
it in both hands he tugged at it; the oak resisted all his
efforts; he tugged again, the oak began to creak, and
moved a little; he mustered all his strength, and tugged
again. The oak fell with a crash to the ground, with its
roots uppermost, and there, where they had stood firmly
fixed so many hundred years, was a deep hole.</p>

<p>Looking down he saw the iron-bound coffer; he fetched
it up, broke open the lock with a stone, raised the lid,
picked up the hare lying in it by its ears; but at that
moment the duck, which had been sitting under the hare,
took the alarm, and flew off straight to sea.</p>

<p>The prince fired a shot after her; the bullet hit the duck;
she gave one loud quack, and fell; but in that same instant
<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>the egg fell from her&mdash;down to the bottom of the sea. The
prince gave a cry of despair; but just then a great fish came
swimming, dived down to the depths of the sea, and
coming to the shore, with the egg in its jaws, left it on
the sand.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE DRAGON WHO KEPT WATCH</p>

<p>The fish swam away; but the prince, taking up the egg,
mounted his horse once more; and they swam till they
reached Princess Miranda's island, where they saw a great
iron wall stretching all round her white marble palace.</p>

<p>There was only one entrance through this iron wall to the
palace, and before this lay the monstrous dragon with the
twelve heads, six of which kept guard alternately; when
the one half slept the other six remained awake. If anyone
were to approach the gate he could not escape the horrid jaws.
Nobody could hurt the dragon; for he could only suffer death
by his own act.</p>

<p>The prince stood on the hill before that gate, and
commanded his self-fighting mace, which also had the faculty
of becoming invisible, to go and clear his entrance to the
palace.</p>

<p>The invisible, self-fighting mace fell upon the dragon and
began to thunder on all his heads with such force, that all his
eyes became bloodshot, and he began to hiss fiercely; he
shook his twelve heads, and stretched wide his twelve horrid
jaws; he spread out his forest of claws; but this helped him
not at all, the mace kept on smiting him, moving about so<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
fast, that not a single head escaped, but could only hiss,
groan, and shriek wildly! Now it had given a thousand
blows, the blood gushed from a thousand wounds, and there
was no help for the dragon; he raged, writhed about, and
shrieked in despair; finally, as blow followed blow, and he
could not see who gave them, he gnashed his teeth, belched
forth flame, and at length turned his claws upon himself,
plunging them deep into his own flesh, struggled, writhed,
twisted himself round, and in and out; his blood flowed
freely from his wounds ... and now it was all over with the
dragon.</p>

<p>The prince, seeing this, went into the courtyard of the
palace, put his horse into the stable, and went up by
a winding stair, towards the tower, whence the Princess
Miranda, having seen him, addressed him:</p>

<p>"Welcome, Prince Hero! I saw how you disposed of the
dragon; but do be careful, for my enemy, Kosciey, is in this
palace; he is most powerful, both through his own strength,
and through his sorceries; and if he kills you I can live no
longer.</p>

<p>"Princess Miranda, do not trouble about me. I have the
life of Kosciey in this egg." Then he called out:</p>

<p>"Invisible self-fighting mace, go into the palace and beat
Kosciey."</p>

<p>The mace bestirred itself quickly, battered in the iron
doors, and set upon Kosciey; it smote him on the neck, till<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
he crouched all together, the sparks flew from his eyes, and
there was a noise of so many mills in his ears.</p>

<p>If he had been an ordinary mortal it would have been all
over with him at once; as it was, he was horribly tormented,
and puzzled&mdash;feeling all these blows, and never seeing whence
they came. He sprang about, raved, and raged, till the whole
island resounded with his roaring.</p>

<p>At last he looked through the window, and behold there
he saw Prince Hero. "Ah! that is all your doing!" he
exclaimed; and sprang out into the courtyard, to rush
straight at him, and beat him to a jelly! But the
prince held the egg in one hand ready; and he
squeezed it so hard, that the shell cracked and the yolk and
the white were all spilled together ... and Kosciey fell
lifeless!</p>

<p>And with the death of the enchanter all his charms
were dissolved at once; all the people in the island who
were asleep woke up, and began to stir. The soldiers
woke from sleep, and the drums began to beat; they
formed their ranks, massed themselves in order, and began
to march towards the palace.</p>

<p>And in the palace there was great joy; for Princess
Miranda came towards the prince, gave him her white
hand, and thanked him warmly. They went to the throne-room,
and following the princess's example, her twelve waiting-maids
paired off with twelve young officers of the army,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
and the couples grouped themselves round the throne, on
which the prince and princess were sitting.</p>

<p>And then a priest, arrayed in all his vestments, came
in at the open door, and the prince and princess exchanged
rings, and were married.</p>

<p>And all the other couples were married at the same
time, and after the wedding there was a feast, dancing,
and music, which it is a pleasure to think of. Everywhere
there was rejoicing.</p>

<h2>THE EAGLES</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-t2.jpg" width="158" height="150" alt="T" />
<b>HERE</b> was once a king, who had lost his
wife. They had a family of thirteen&mdash;twelve
gallant sons, and one daughter, who was
exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>For twelve years after his wife's death the king grieved
very much; he used to go daily to her tomb, and there weep,
and pray, and give away alms to the poor. He thought never
to marry again; for he had promised his dying wife never to
give her children a stepmother.</p>

<p>One day, when visiting his dead wife's grave as usual,
he saw beside him a maiden so entrancingly fair, that he fell
in love with her, and soon made her his second queen. But
before long he found out that he had made a great mistake.
Though she was so beautiful she turned out to be a wicked<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
sorceress, and not only made the king himself unhappy, but
proved most unkind to his children, whom she wished out of
the way, so that her own little son might inherit the
kingdom.</p>

<p>One day, when the king was far away, at war against his
enemies, the queen went into her stepchildren's apartments,
and pronounced some magical words&mdash;on which every one of
the twelve princes flew away in the shape of an eagle, and the
princess was changed into a dove.</p>

<p>The queen looked out of the window, to see in what
direction they would fly, when she saw right under the window
an old man, with a beard as white as snow.</p>

<p>"What are you here for, old man?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To be witness of your deed," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then you saw it?"</p>

<p>"I saw it."</p>

<p>"Then be what I command!"</p>

<p>She whispered some magical words. The old man
disappeared in a blaze of sunshine; and the queen, as
she stood there, dumb with terror, was changed into a
basilisk.</p>

<p>The basilisk ran off in fright; trying to hide herself
underground. But her glance was so deadly, that it killed
every one she looked at; so that all the people in the palace
were soon dead, including her own son, whom she slew
by merely looking at him. And this once populous and
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>happy royal residence quickly became an uninhabited ruin,
which no one dared approach, for fear of the basilisk
lurking in its underground vaults.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD MAN BLESSES THE PRINCESS</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princess, who had been changed into a
dove, flew after her brothers the eagles, but not being able
to overtake them, she rested under a wayside cross, and
began cooing mournfully.</p>

<p>"What are you grieving for, pretty dove?" asked
an old man, with a snow-white beard, who just then
came by.</p>

<p>"I am grieving for my poor dear father, who is fighting
in the wars far away; for my loved brothers, who have
flown away from me into the clouds. I am grieving also
for myself. Not long ago I was a happy princess; and now
I must wander over the world as a dove, to hide from the
birds of prey&mdash;and be parted for ever from my dear
father and brothers!"</p>

<p>"You may grieve and weep, little dove; but do not lose
hope," said the old man. "Sorrow is only for a time, and all
will come right in the end."</p>

<p>So saying he stroked the little dove, and she at once
regained her natural shape. She kissed the old man's hand
in her gratitude, saying:</p>

<p>"How can I ever thank you enough! But since
you are so kind, will you not tell me how to rescue my
brothers?"<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>The old man gave her an ever-growing loaf, and said:</p>

<p>"This loaf is enough to sustain, not only you, but a
thousand people for a thousand years, without ever diminishing.
Go towards the sunset, and weep your tears into this little
bottle. And when it is full...."</p>

<p>And the old man told her what else to do, blessed her, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>The princess travelled on towards the sunset; and in
about a year she reached the boundary of the next world, and
stood before an iron door, where Death was keeping guard
with his scythe.</p>

<p>"Stop, princess!" he said; "You can proceed no further,
for you are not yet parted by death from your own
world."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" she asked. "Must I go back
without my poor brothers?"</p>

<p>"Your brothers," said Death, "fly here every day in the
guise of eagles. They want to reach the other side of this
door, which leads into the other world; for they hate the one
they live in; nevertheless they, and you also, must remain
there, until your time be come. Therefore every day I must
compel them to go back, which they can do, because they are
eagles. But how are you going to get back yourself?&mdash;look
there!"</p>

<p>The princess looked around her, and wept bitterly. For
though she had not perceived this before, nor seen how she<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
got there, she saw now that she was in a deep abyss, shut
in on all sides by such high precipices, that she wondered
how her brothers, even with eagle wings, could fly to
the top.</p>

<p>But remembering what the mysterious old man had
said she took courage, and began to pray and weep, till
she had filled the little bottle with her tears. Soon she
heard the sound of wings over her head, and saw twelve
eagles flying.</p>

<p>The eagles dashed themselves against the iron portal,
beating their wings upon it, and imploring Death to open
it to them. But Death only threatened them with his
scythe, saying:</p>

<p>"Hence! ye enchanted princes! you must fulfil your
penance on earth, till I come for you myself."</p>

<p>The eagles were about to turn and fly, when all at once
they perceived their sister. They came round her, and
caressed her hands lovingly with their beaks.</p>

<p>She at once began to sprinkle them with her tears from
the lachrymatory; and in one moment the twelve eagles
were changed back into the twelve princes, and joyfully
embraced their sister.</p>

<p>The princess then fed them all round from her ever-growing
loaf; but when their hunger was appeased they
began to be troubled as to how they were to ascend from the
abyss, since they had no longer eagles' wings to fly up.<span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>But the princess knelt down and prayed:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Bird of heavenly pity here,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">By each labour, prayer and tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come in thine unvanquished power,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come and aid us in this hour!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And all at once there shot down from heaven to the depth
of the abyss a ray of sunshine, on which descended a gigantic
bird, with rainbow wings, a bright sparkling crest, and peacock's
eyes all over his body, a golden tail, and silvery breast.</p>

<p>"What are your commands, princess?" asked the bird.</p>

<p>"Carry us from this threshold of eternity to our own world."</p>

<p>"I will, but you must know, princess, that before I can
reach the top of this precipice with you on my back, three
days and nights must pass; and I must have food on the
way, or my strength will fail me, and I shall fall down with
you to the bottom, and we shall all perish."</p>

<p>"I have an ever-growing loaf, which will suffice both for
you and ourselves," replied the princess.</p>

<p>"Then climb upon my back, and whenever I look round,
give me some bread to eat."</p>

<p>The bird was so large that all the princes, and the
princess in the midst of them, could easily find place on
his back, and he began to fly upwards.</p>

<p>He flew higher and higher, and whenever he looked
round at her, she gave him bits of the loaf, and he flew
on, and upwards.<span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>So they went on steadily for two nights and days;
but upon the third day, when they were hoping in a short
time to view the summit of the precipice, and to land upon
the borders of this world, the bird looked round as usual
for a piece of the loaf.</p>

<p>The princess was just going to break off some to give
him, when a sudden violent gust of wind from the bottom
of the abyss snatched the loaf from her hand, and sent it
whistling downwards.</p>

<p>Not having received his usual meal the bird became
sensibly weaker, and looked round once more.</p>

<p>The princess trembled with fear; she had nothing more
to give him, and she felt that he was becoming exhausted.
In utter desperation she cut off a piece of her flesh, and
gave it to him.</p>

<p>Having eaten this the bird recovered strength, and flew
upwards faster than before; but after an hour or two he
looked round once more.</p>

<p>So she cut off another piece of her flesh; the bird seized
it greedily, and flew on so fast that in a few minutes he
reached the ground at the top of the precipice. When they
alighted, and he asked her:</p>

<p>"Princess, what were those two delicious morsels you
gave me last? I never ate anything so good before."</p>

<p>"They were part of my flesh, I had nothing else for
you," replied the princess in a faint voice, for she was
swooning away with pain and loss of blood.<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>The bird breathed upon her wounds; and the flesh at
once healed over, and grew again as before. Then he
flew up again to heaven, and was lost in the clouds.</p>

<p>The princess and her brothers resumed their journey,
this time towards the sunrise, and at last arrived in their
own country, where they met their father, returning from
the wars.</p>

<p>The king was coming back victorious over his enemies,
and on his way home had first heard of the sudden disappearance
of his children and of the queen, and how
his palace was tenanted only by a basilisk with a death-dealing
glance.</p>

<p>He was therefore most surprised and overjoyed to meet
his dear children once more, and on the way his daughter
told him all that had come to pass.</p>

<p>When they got back to the palace the king sent one
of his nobles with a looking-glass down into the underground
vaults. The basilisk saw herself reflected in this
mirror, and her own glance slew her immediately.</p>

<p>They gathered up the remains of the basilisk, and burnt
them in a great fire in the courtyard, afterwards scattering
the ashes to the four winds. When this was done
the king, his sons, and his daughter, returned to live in
their former home and were all as happy as could be ever
after.</p>

<h2>THE WHIRLWIND</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="148" height="150" alt="i" />
<b>N</b> a far-off country, beyond the sea and the
mountains, there lived a king and queen,
with a beautiful daughter, who was called
Princess Ladna.</p>

<p>A great many princes came to woo her; but she liked only
one of them, called Prince Dobrotek; so they confessed their
love for one another to the king, who gave his consent, and
the wedding-day was fixed.</p>

<p>Now among the princess's rejected suitors there was one,
who though he had changed himself into the shape of a prince,
in order to come to court and make love to her, really was an
ugly dwarf, only seven inches high, but with a beard more
than seven feet long, and a great hump on his back. He
was so offended with the princess for refusing him,
that he determined to carry her off; so he watched his
opportunity.<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>As the young couple, with all their followers and their
guests, were leaving the palace to go to church, a violent
wind began to blow, a regular whirlwind, raising a column of
sand, and lifting the princess off her feet. She was carried
up over the clouds, to the top of some inaccessible mountains,
and dropped down into a magnificent palace, with a golden
roof, and a high wall all round.</p>

<p>After a while the princess woke up from the fainting-fit
into which she had fallen. She looked round the splendid
apartment in which she was, and came to the conclusion
that some young and handsome prince must have carried
her off.</p>

<p>In the room there was a table ready spread; all the plates
and dishes, as well as the knives, forks, and spoons, were of
silver and gold; and the dinner itself was so good, that in
spite of her grief and terror, she could not refrain from tasting
it; and she had no sooner tasted, than she ate, till her appetite
was appeased.</p>

<p>Then the doors opened, and there came in a company of
negroes, bearing a great chair, in which sat the ugly dwarf,
with the long beard and the great hump.</p>

<p>The dwarf now began to pay his court to the princess, and
explain how he had carried her off in the guise of the
whirlwind, because he loved her so much. But she would
not listen to him, and gave him a sounding slap with her
open hand right in his face, so that sparks danced before his<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
eyes. Of course he was in a great passion; but for love of
her he managed to keep his temper, and turned round to
leave the room. But in his haste he caught his feet in his
long beard, and was thrown down on the threshold, and in
his fall he dropped his cap, which he was holding in
one hand.</p>

<p>The negroes helped him again into the chair, and carried
him out; but the princess jumped up, locked the door, and
took up the cap that was lying on the ground. She put it
on; and went to the glass to see how she looked in it. But
what was her surprise to find that she could not see herself,
till she took it off! So she came to the wise conclusion that
this was an invisible cap; at which she was highly delighted;
she put on the cap again, and began to walk about the room.</p>

<p>The door opened once more with a loud noise, and the
dwarf came in with his long beard thrown back and twisted all
round his hump, to be out of the way. But not seeing either
his cap, or the princess, he guessed what had happened; so
full of wild despair he began to rush madly about the room,
knocking himself against the tables and chairs, while the
princess made her escape through the door, and ran out into
the garden.</p>

<p>The garden was very extensive, and full of beautiful fruit-trees;
so she lived upon these fruits, and drank the water of
a spring in the garden for some time. She used to make fun
of the dwarf's impotent rage. Sometimes when he rushed<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
wildly about the garden, she would tease him by taking off
the invisible cap, so that he saw her before him, in all her
beauty; but when he made a rush after her she would put
it on again, and become invisible to him; she would then
throw cherry-stones at him, come close to him, and laugh
loudly: and then run away again.</p>

<p>One day, when she was playing about in this manner,
her cap got caught in the boughs of a tree, and fell upon a
gooseberry bush. The dwarf saw it, and seized hold of the
princess with one hand, and of the cap with the other. But
just then&mdash;from the summit of the mountain, above the
garden itself, was heard the sound of a trumpet-challenge,
three times repeated.</p>

<p>At this the dwarf trembled with rage; but first breathing
upon the princess, he put her to sleep with his breath, then
placed his invisible cap on her head. Having done this he
seized his two-edged sword, and flew up into the clouds, so
as to strike the knight who had challenged him from above,
and destroy him at one stroke.</p>

<p>But where did this knight come from?</p>

<p>When Princess Ladna had been carried off on her wedding-day
by the whirlwind, there was the greatest consternation
among all the bystanders. Her distracted father and her
bridegroom rushed about in all directions, and sent courtiers
everywhere in search of her; but the princess had been neither
seen nor heard of, nor was any trace left of her.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>The king (very unnecessarily) told Prince Dobrotek that if
he did not get back his daughter, the princess, he would not
only put him to death, but would reduce his whole country to
ashes. He also told all the princes there that whoever should
bring back his daughter should have her to wife, and receive
half of his kingdom into the bargain.</p>

<p>When they heard this they all got to horse, and galloped
in various directions; among them Prince Dobrotek.</p>

<p>He went on for three days, never stopping for food or
rest; but on the fourth day, at dusk, he felt overcome by
sleep; so he let his horse go free in a meadow, and himself
lay down on the grass. Then all at once he heard a piercing
shriek, and straight before him beheld a hare, and an owl
perched upon it&mdash;its claws digging into the poor creature's
side.</p>

<p>The prince caught up the first thing that lay near him,
and aimed at the screech-owl, so truly that he killed it on the
spot, and the hare ran up to him, like a tame creature,
licked his hands, and ran away.</p>

<p>Then the prince saw that the thing he had thrown at
the owl was a human skull. And it spoke to him, in these
words:</p>

<p>"Prince Dobrotek, I thank you for what you have done
for me. When I was alive I committed suicide, and was
therefore condemned to lie unburied at this cross-way, till
I should be the means of saving life. I have lain here<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
for seven hundred and seventy-seven years; and Heaven
knows how much longer I should have had to remain, if
you had not chanced to throw me at the screech-owl, and
so saved the life of the poor hare. Now bury me, so that
I may lie peacefully in the ground at this same place, and
I will tell you how to summon the Grey Seer-horse, with
the golden mane, who will always help you in case of
need. Go out into a plain, and without looking behind
you, call out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Grey Seer-horse, with golden mane!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Like a bird&mdash;and not like steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On the blast&mdash;and not the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fly thou hither unto me!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus having spoken, the head was silent; but a blue
light shot up from it towards the sky; it was the soul of
the deceased, which having now expiated its sin by its long
imprisonment in the skull, had attained heaven.</p>

<p>The prince then dug a grave, and buried the skull.
He then called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Grey Seer-horse, with golden mane!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Like a bird&mdash;and not like steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On the blast&mdash;and not the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Do thou hither fly to me!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wind rose, the lightning flashed, the thunder roared,
and the wonderful horse with the golden mane appeared.
He flew as fast as the storm-wind, flames shot from his
<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>nostrils, sparks from his eyes, and clouds of smoke
from his mouth. He stood still, and said in human
tones:</p>

<a name="THE_HORSE_APPEARS_IN_THE_STORM"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">THE HORSE APPEARS IN THE STORM</p>

<p>"What are your commands, Prince Dobrotek?"</p>

<p>"I am in trouble; I wish you to help me."</p>

<p>And he told him all that had occurred.</p>

<p>"Creep in at my left ear," said the horse, "and creep out
again at the right."</p>

<p>So the prince crept in at the horse's left ear, and came
out again at the right one, all clad in golden armour. He
also found himself miraculously increased in strength, so
that when he stamped on the ground it trembled; and
when he shouted a storm arose, which shook the leaves
from the trees.</p>

<p>Then he asked the horse:</p>

<p>"What is to be done next?"</p>

<p>"Your betrothed, Princess Ladna," said the horse, "was
carried off by the seven-inch-high dwarf, with the seven-foot-long
beard; he is a powerful magician; he dwells beyond the
seven seas, among inaccessible mountains. He can only be
conquered by the All-Cutting Sword, which sword is jealously
guarded by his own brother, the Giant-Head, with basilisk
eye. To this Giant-Head we must therefore go."</p>

<p>Prince Dobrotek mounted on horseback, and they flew
like an arrow, over lands and seas, high mountains and wide
oceans. They stopped at length upon a wide plain<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
strewn with bones, before a moving mountain. And the
horse said:</p>

<p>"This moving mountain, which you see before you, is the
giant's head with the basilisk eyes; and the bones strewn so
thickly hereabouts prove how deadly his looks are&mdash;so be
careful. He is now asleep from the heat of the sun; but only
two steps before him lies the sword, with which alone you can
conquer your enemy. Lie down along my back, so that his
glance cannot reach you through my neck and mane; but
when you get near to it, lay hold of the sword; when
you have it you will not only be safe from his basilisk
glances, but you will even have the giant's head at your
mercy."</p>

<p>And the horse drew near lightly, and the prince bent
down, and secured the wonderful sword; but he shouted so
loud that the Giant-Head woke up, sniffed hard, and looked
about with his bloodshot eyes; and seeing the wonderful
sword in the prince's hand, he called out:</p>

<p>"Sir knight! are you weary of the world, that you
court speedy death?"</p>

<p>"You need not boast like that, you empty head!"
replied Prince Dobrotek. "Your looks cannot hurt me
now; and you shall die by this All-Cutting Sword! But
I would first know who, and what you are."</p>

<p>"Then I confess, prince," replied the head; "that I
am in your power; but be merciful to me, for I am worthy<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
of pity. I am a knight of the race of giants, and were
it not for the envy of my brother, I should still have been
happy. He was the black sheep of our family, and was
born an ugly dwarf, with a long beard; and my
handsome giant-like proportions caused him to hate me
bitterly. His only good point is his great strength, and it
all resides in his long beard, and so long as it is not cut
he cannot be conquered, and this can only be done by that
sword, which you now hold.</p>

<p>"One day, being bent upon my destruction, he said to
me:</p>

<p>"'Brother, do not refuse to help me. I have read in my
books of magic that beyond the mountains, on a plain lies
buried a certain sword, whereby a knight, seeking for his
betrothed, shall compass the destruction of us both; let
us therefore go and dig it up, so that we shall escape the
threatened doom!'</p>

<p>"To this I agreed. I took a hundred-year-old pine&mdash;torn
up from its roots&mdash;on one arm, and carried my brother
on my other. We set out; he showed me the spot, and
I dug up the sword, on this same plain. Then we began
to quarrel about who should possess it. After a long
dispute he said:</p>

<p>"'We were best decide it by lot, brother. Let each of us
lay his ear to the ground, and whoever first hears the sound
of the evening bell shall have the sword.'<span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>"So he laid his ear to the ground, and I mine. I listened;
but heard nothing; and he meantime, having got hold
of the sword, crept up to me, and cut my head from my
shoulders.</p>

<p>"My headless trunk, left unburied, rotted away, and the
grass grew over it; but my head, endowed with supernatural
life by the malicious dwarf, my brother, was left here, with
charge to guard this sword, and kill every one who came near
with my deadly glance. After many centuries you have won
it; so I implore you to cut off his seven-foot beard, and make
him into mince-meat; and avenge me."</p>

<p>"You shall be avenged," said the prince; "and at once.
Grey Seer-Horse, carry me to the kingdom of the dwarf
magician, with the seven-foot-long beard."</p>

<p>So they set off at once, flying with lightning speed through
the air, over the seas and over the forests. In an hour or two
they halted on the summit of a high mountain, and the horse
said:</p>

<p>"These mountains are the kingdom of the dwarf magician,
who carried off your betrothed, and they are both now in the
garden; challenge him to fight."</p>

<p>Prince Dobrotek sounded a challenge three times, and the
dwarf, as we have seen, flew up into the air, so as to swoop
down upon his antagonist, unperceived of him.</p>

<p>All at once the prince heard a murmuring sound above
him, and he saw when he looked up, the dwarf soaring<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
above him, like an eagle in the clouds&mdash;for he had the
magic power of increasing his size and strength&mdash;with his
sword drawn, ready to fall upon him.</p>

<p>The prince sprang aside, and the dwarf came down,
with such an impetus, that his head and neck were rammed
into the ground.</p>

<p>The prince dismounted, seized the dwarf by the beard,
wound it about his left hand, and began to sever it with
the All-Cutting Sword.</p>

<p>The dwarf saw that he had to do with no feather-bed
knight; so he tugged with all his strength, and flew up
again into the clouds; but the prince, holding fast with
his left hand to the beard, kept on severing it with his
sword, so that he had nearly cut half of it through; and
the dwarf became weaker and weaker the more hair he
lost, so he began to cry for mercy.</p>

<p>"Drop down to the ground, off which you took me,"
said the prince.</p>

<p>The dwarf dropped down slowly, but the prince cut off
the remainder of his beard and threw him&mdash;when thus
deprived of his charms and his strength alike&mdash;on to the
ground, wreathed the severed beard round his own helmet,
and entered the palace.</p>

<p>The invisible servants of the dwarf, seeing their master's
beard, wreathed about the prince's helmet, threw open all
the doors to him at once.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>He went through all the rooms; but not finding his
princess anywhere, went into the garden, traversing all the
paths and lawns, and calling her name. He could find her
nowhere.</p>

<p>But thus running from one place to another he chanced to
touch the invisible cap; he caught hold of it, and pulled it
away from where it was, on the head of the princess, and saw
her at once in all her loveliness, but fast asleep.</p>

<p>Overcome with joy, he called her by her name; but she
had been cast into such a deep sleep by the dwarf's poisonous
breath, that he could not rouse her.</p>

<p>He took her up in his arms, put the invisible cap into his
pocket, also picking up the wicked dwarf, whom he carried
along with him. He then mounted his horse, flew like an
arrow, and in a few minutes stood before the Giant-Head,
with the basilisk eyes.</p>

<p>He threw the dwarf into its open jaws, where he was
ground at once into powder; the prince then cut up the
monstrous head into small pieces, and scattered them all over
the plain.</p>

<p>Thus having got rid of both the dwarf and the giant, the
prince rode on with the sleeping princess, upon the Golden-Mane
horse, and at sunset they came to the same cross-roads,
where he had first summoned him.</p>

<p>"Here, prince, we must part," said the Golden-Mane;
"but here in the meadow is your own horse, and it is not far<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
to your own home, so creep into my right ear, and come out
at my left."</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE DWARF DEFEATED</p>

<p>The prince did as he was told, and came out as he was
before. His own horse recognized him, and came running
with a joyful neigh to meet his master.</p>

<p>The prince was tired out with the long journey, so, having
laid down his betrothed wife, still sleeping, on the soft grass,
and covered her up from the cold, he laid down himself
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>But that very night, one of Princess Ladna's rejected
suitors, riding that way, saw by the light of the moon those
two asleep, and he recognized in them the princess, and
the prince, his fortunate rival. So first stabbing the latter
through with his sabre, he carried off the princess, and bore
her on horseback before him to her father.</p>

<p>The king welcomed him rapturously, as his daughter's
deliverer. But when he found, to his dismay, that he could
not awake her, with all his caresses, he asked the supposed
rescuer what this meant.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Sir King," replied the knight. "After
I had overtaken and slain the great enchanter, who was
carrying off the princess, I found her as she is now, sound
asleep."</p>

<p>Prince Dobrotek meanwhile, mortally wounded, had just
strength enough left to summon the Wonderful Grey Horse,
who came instantly; and seeing what was the matter, flew<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
off to the top of the mountain of Everlasting Life. On its
summit were three springs&mdash;the Water of Loosening, the
Water of Healing, and the Water of Life. He sprinkled
the dead prince with all three; Prince Dobrotek opened
his eyes, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh! how well I have slept!"</p>

<p>"You were sleeping the sleep of death," returned the
Golden-Mane; "one of your rivals killed you sleeping,
and carried off your princess home to her father, pretending
to be her deliverer, in the hope of gaining her hand. But
do not be afraid; she is still asleep, and only you can
awaken her, by touching her forehead with the beard of
the dwarf, which you have with you. Go then to her; I
must be elsewhere."</p>

<p>The Golden-Mane vanished, and the prince, calling his
own horse, and taking with him his invisible cap, betook
himself to the court of his loved one's father.</p>

<p>But when he drew near he found that the city was all
surrounded by enemies, who had already mastered the outer
defences, and were threatening the town itself; and half of its
defenders being slain, the rest were thinking of surrender.</p>

<p>Prince Dobrotek put on his invisible cap, and drawing his
All-Cutting Sword, fell upon the enemy.</p>

<p>They fell to right and left as the sword smote them on
each side, till one half of them were slain, and the rest ran
away into the forest.<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>Unseen by anyone the prince entered the city, and arrived
at the royal palace, where the king, surrounded by his knights,
was hearing the account of this sudden attack, whereby his
foes had been discomfited; but by whom no one could inform
him.</p>

<p>Then Prince Dobrotek took off his invisible cap, and
appearing suddenly in the midst of the assembly, said:</p>

<p>"King and father! it was I who beat your enemies. But
where is my betrothed, Princess Ladna, whom I rescued
from the wizard dwarf, with the seven-foot beard? whom
one of your knights treacherously stole from me? Let me
see her, that I may waken her from her magic sleep."</p>

<p>When the traitor knight heard this he took to his
heels; Prince Dobrotek touched the sleeping princess's
forehead with the beard, she woke up directly, gazed at him
fondly with her lovely eyes, but could not at first understand
where she was, or what had happened to her.</p>

<p>The king caught her in his arms, pressed her to his heart,
and that very evening he married her to Prince Dobrotek.
He gave them half his kingdom, and there was a splendid
wedding, such as had never been seen or heard of before.<span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<h2>THE GOOD FERRYMAN AND THE WATER NYMPHS</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-t3.jpg" width="155" height="150" alt="T" />
<b>HERE</b> was once an old man, very poor,
with three sons. They lived chiefly by ferrying
people over a river; but he had had
nothing but ill-luck all his life. And to crown
all, on the night he died, there was a great storm, and
in it the crazy old ferry-boat, on which his sons depended
for a living, was sunk.</p>

<p>As they were lamenting both their father and their
poverty, an old man came by, and learning the reason of
their sorrow said:</p>

<p>"Never mind; all will come right in time. Look!
there is your boat as good as new."</p>

<p>And there was a fine new ferry-boat on the water, in
place of the old one, and a number of people waiting to
be ferried over.</p>

<p>The three brothers arranged to take turns with the boat,
and divide the fares they took.</p>

<p>They were however very different in disposition. The
two elder brothers were greedy and avaricious, and would<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
never take anyone over the river, without being handsomely
paid for it.</p>

<p>But the youngest brother took over poor people, who
had no money, for nothing; and moreover frequently relieved
their wants out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>One day, at sunset, when the eldest brother was
at the ferry the same old man, who had visited them
on the night their father died, came, and asked for a
passage.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to pay you with, but this empty purse,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Go and get something to put in it then first," replied
the ferry-man; "and be off with you now!"</p>

<p>Next day it was the second brother's turn; and the same
old man came, and offered his empty purse as his fare. But
he met with a like reply.</p>

<p>The third day it was the youngest brother's turn; and
when the old man arrived, and asked to be ferried over for
charity, he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, get in, old man."</p>

<p>"And what is the fare?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"That depends upon whether you can pay or not,"
was the reply; "but if you cannot, it is all the same
to me."</p>

<p>"A good deed is never without its reward," said the old
man: "but in the meantime take this empty purse; though<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
it is very worn, and looks worth nothing. But if you shake
it, and say:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'For his sake who gave it, this purse I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I wish may always be full of gold;'<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>it will always afford you as much gold as you wish
for."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</a>
<a name="THE_PURSE_THAT_WAS_EVER_FULL"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">THE PURSE THAT WAS EVER FULL</p>

<p>The youngest brother came home, and his brothers, who
were sitting over a good supper, laughed at him, because he
had taken only a few copper coins that day, and they told
him he should have no supper. But when he began to
shake his purse and scatter gold coins all about, they
jumped up from the table, and began picking them up
eagerly.</p>

<p>And as it was share and share alike, they all grew rich
very quickly. The youngest brother made good use of his
riches, for he gave away money freely to the poor. But
the greedy elder brothers envied him the possession of the
wonderful purse, and contrived to steal it from him. Then
they left their old home; and the one bought a ship, laded
it with all sorts of merchandize, for a trading voyage. But
the ship ran upon a rock, and every one on board was
drowned. The second brother was no more fortunate, for as
he was travelling through a forest, with an enormous treasure
of precious stones, in which he had laid out his wealth, to
sell at a profit, he was waylaid by robbers, who murdered
him, and shared the spoil among them.<span class="pagenum">[56]</span></p>

<p>The youngest brother, who remained at home, having lost
his purse, became as poor as before. But he still did as
formerly, took pay from passengers who could afford it,
ferried over poor folks for nothing, and helped those who
were poorer than himself so far as he could.</p>

<p>One day the same old man with the long white beard
came by; the ferry-man welcomed him as an old friend, and
while rowing him over the river, told him all that had
happened since he last saw him.</p>

<p>"Your brothers did very wrong, and they have paid for
it," said the old man; "but you were in fault yourself. Still,
I will give you one more chance. Take this hook and line;
and whatever you catch, mind you hold fast, and not let it
escape you; or you will bitterly repent it."</p>

<p>The old man then disappeared, and the ferry-man looked
in wonder at his new fishing-tackle&mdash;a diamond hook, a
silver line, and a golden rod.</p>

<p>All at once the hook sprang of itself into the water; the
line lengthened out along the river current, and there came
a strong pull upon it. The fisherman drew it in, and beheld
a most lovely creature, upwards from the waist a woman,
but with a fish's tail.</p>

<p>"Good ferry-man, let me go," she said; "take your hook
out of my hair! The sun is setting, and after sunset I
can no longer be a water-nymph again."</p>

<p>But without answering, the ferry-man only held her fast,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
and covered her over with his coat, to prevent her escaping.
Then the sun set, and she lost her fish-tail.</p>

<p>"Now," she said: "I am yours; so let us go to the
nearest church and get married."</p>

<p>She was already dressed as a bride, with a myrtle garland
on her head, in a white dress, with a rainbow-coloured girdle,
and rich jewels in her hair and on her neck. And she held
in her hand the wonderful purse, that was always full of
gold.</p>

<p>They found the priest and all ready at the church; were
married in a few minutes; and then came home to their
wedding-feast, to which all the neighbours were invited.
They were royally entertained, and when they were about to
leave the bride shook the wonderful purse, and sent a shower
of gold pieces flying among the guests; so they all went home
very well pleased.</p>

<p>The good ferry-man and his marvellous wife lived most
happily together; they never wanted for anything, and gave
freely to all who came. He continued to ply his ferry-boat;
but he now took all passengers over for nothing, and gave
them each a piece of gold into the bargain.</p>

<p>Now there was a king over that country, who a year ago
had just succeeded to his elder brother. He had heard of the
ferry-man, who was so marvellously rich, and wishing to
ascertain the truth of the story he had heard, came on purpose
to see for himself. But when he saw the ferry-man's beautiful<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
young wife, he resolved to have her for himself, and
determined to get rid of her husband somehow.</p>

<p>At that time there was an eclipse of the sun; and the king
sent for the ferry-man, and told him he must find out the
cause of this eclipse, or be put to death.</p>

<p>He came home in great distress to his wife; but she
replied:</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear. I will tell you what to do, and
how to gratify the king's curiosity."</p>

<p>So she gave him a wonderful ball of thread, which he
was to throw before him, and follow the thread as it kept
unwinding&mdash;towards the East.</p>

<p>He went on a long way, over high mountains, deep rivers,
and wide regions. At last he came to a ruined city, where
a number of corpses were lying about unburied, tainting
the air with pestilence.</p>

<p>The good man was sorry to see this, and took the pains
to summon men from the neighbouring cities, and get the
bodies properly buried. He then resumed his journey.</p>

<p>He came at last to the ends of the earth. Here he found
a magnificent golden palace, with an amber roof, and
diamond doors and windows.</p>

<p>The ball of thread went straight into the palace, and the
ferry-man found himself in a vast apartment, where sat a
very dignified old lady, spinning from a golden distaff.</p>

<p>"Wretched man! what are you here for?" she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
when she saw him. "My son will come back presently
and burn you up."</p>

<p>He explained to her how he had been forced to come,
out of sheer necessity.</p>

<p>"Well, I must help you," replied the old lady, who was
no less than the Mother of the Sun, "because you did Sol
that good turn some days ago, in burying the inhabitants
of that town, when they were killed by a dragon. He
journeys every day across the wide arch of heaven, in a
diamond car, drawn by twelve grey horses, with golden
manes, giving heat and light to the whole world. He will
soon be back here, to rest for the night.... But ... here
he comes; hide yourself, and take care to observe what
follows."</p>

<p>So saying she changed her visitor into a lady-bird, and let
him fly to the window.</p>

<p>Then the neighing of the wonderful horses and the rattling
of chariot wheels were heard, and the bright Sun himself
presently came in, and stretching himself upon a coral bed,
remarked to his mother:</p>

<p>"I smell a human being here!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense you talk!" replied his mother. "How
could any human being come here? You know it is
impossible."</p>

<p>The Sun, as if he did not quite believe her, began to peer
anxiously about the room.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>"Don't be so restless," said the old lady; "but tell me
why you suffered eclipse a month or two ago."</p>

<p>"How could I help it?" answered the Sun; "When the
dragon from the deep abyss attacked me, and I had to fight
him? Perhaps I should have been fighting with the monster
till now, if a wonderful mermaid had not come to help me.
When she began to sing, and looked at the dragon with her
beautiful eyes, all his rage softened at once; he was absorbed
in gazing upon her beauty, and I meanwhile burnt him to
ashes, and threw them into the sea."</p>

<p>The Sun then went to sleep, and his mother again touched
the ferry-man with her spindle; he then returned to his
natural shape, and slipped out of the palace. Following
the ball of thread he reached home at last, and next day went
to the king, and told him all.</p>

<p>But the king was so enchanted at the description of the
beautiful sea-maiden, that he ordered the ferry-man to go and
bring her to him, on pain of death.</p>

<p>He went home very sad to his wife, but she told him she
would manage this also. So saying she gave him another
ball of thread, to show him which way to go, and she also
gave him a carriage-load of costly lady's apparel and jewels,
and ornaments&mdash;told him what he was to do, and they took
leave of one another.</p>

<p>On the way the ferry-man met a youth, riding on a fine
grey horse, who asked:<span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>"What have you got there, man?"</p>

<p>"A woman's wearing apparel, most costly and beautiful"&mdash;he
had several dresses, not simply one.</p>

<p>"I say, give me some of those as a present for my
intended, whom I am going to see. I can be of use to you,
for I am the Storm-wind. I will come, whenever you call
upon me thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Storm-wind! Storm-wind! come with speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Help me in my sudden need!'"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ferry-man gave him some of the most beautiful
things he had, and the Storm-wind passed.</p>

<p>A little further on he met an old man, grey-haired, but
strong and vigorous-looking, who also said:</p>

<p>"What have you got there?"</p>

<p>"Women's garments costly and beautiful."</p>

<p>"I am going to my daughter's wedding; she is to marry
the Storm-wind; give me something as a wedding present for
her, and I will be of use to you. I am the Frost; if you need
me call upon me thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Frost, I call thee; come with speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Help me in my sudden need!'"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ferry-man let him take all he wanted and went on.</p>

<p>And now he came to the sea-coast; here the ball of thread
stopped, and would go no further.</p>

<p>The ferry-man waded up to his waist into the sea, and set<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
up two high poles, with cross-bars between them, upon which
he hung dresses of various colours, scarves, and ribbons, gold
chains, and diamond earrings and pins, shoes, and looking-glasses,
and then hid himself, with his wonderful hook and
line ready.</p>

<p>As soon as the morning rose from the sea, there appeared
far away on the smooth waters a silvery boat, in which stood
a beautiful maiden, with a golden oar in one hand, while with
the other she gathered together her long golden hair, all the
while singing so beautifully to the rising sun, that, if the
ferry-man had not quickly stopped his ears, he would have
fallen into a delicious reverie, and then asleep.</p>

<p>She sailed along a long time in her silver boat, and round
her leaped and played golden fishes with rainbow wings and
diamond eyes. But all at once she perceived the rich clothes
and ornaments, hung up on the poles, and as she came nearer,
the ferry-man called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Storm-wind! Storm-wind! come with speed!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Help me in my sudden need!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the Storm-wind.</p>

<p>The ferry-man without answering him, called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Frost, I call thee; come with speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Help me in my sudden need!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the Frost.</p>

<p>"I want to capture the sea-maiden."</p>

<p>Then the wind blew and blew, so that the silver boat was
<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>capsized, and the frost breathed on the sea till it was frozen
over.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE MEETING OF THE SISTERS</p>

<p>Then the ferryman rushed up to the sea-maiden, entangling
his hook in her golden hair; lifted her on his horse, and rode
off as swift as the wind after his wonderful ball of thread.</p>

<p>She kept weeping and lamenting all the way; but as soon
as they reached the ferry-man's home, and saw his wife, all her
sorrow changed into joy; she laughed with delight, and
threw herself into her arms.</p>

<p>And then it turned out that the two were sisters.</p>

<p>Next morning the ferry-man went to court with both his
wife and sister-in-law, and the king was so delighted with the
beauty of the latter, that he at once offered to marry her.
But she could give him no answer until he had the Self-playing
Guitar.</p>

<p>So the king ordered the ferry-man to procure him this
wonderful guitar, or be put to death.</p>

<p>His wife told him what to do, and gave him a handkerchief
of hers, embroidered with gold, telling him to use
this in case of need.</p>

<p>Following the ball of thread he came at last to a great
lake, in the midst of which was a green island.</p>

<p>He began to wonder how he was to get there, when he
saw a boat approaching, in which was an old man, with a
long white beard, and he recognized him with delight, as his
former benefactor.<span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>"How are you, ferry-man?" he asked. "Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"I am going wherever the ball of thread leads me, for I
must fetch the Self-playing Guitar."</p>

<p>"This guitar," said the old man, "belongs to Goldmore,
the lord of that island. It is a difficult matter to have
to do with him; but perhaps you may succeed. You
have often ferried me over the water; I will ferry you
now."</p>

<p>The old man pushed off, and they reached the island.</p>

<p>On arriving the ball of thread went straight into a
palace, where Goldmore came out to meet the traveller, and
asked him where he was going and what he wanted.</p>

<p>He explained:</p>

<p>"I am come for the Self-playing Guitar."</p>

<p>"I will only let you have it on condition that you do not
go to sleep for three days and nights. And if you do, you
will not only lose all chance of the Self-playing Guitar;
but you must die."</p>

<p>What could the poor man do, but agree to this?</p>

<p>So Goldmore conducted him to a great room, and locked
him in. The floor was strewn with sleepy-grass, so he fell
asleep directly.</p>

<p>Next morning in came Goldmore, and on waking him
up said:</p>

<p>"So you went to sleep! Very well, you shall die!"<span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>And he touched a spring in the floor, and the unhappy
ferry-man fell down into an apartment beneath, where the
walls were of looking-glass, and there were great heaps
of gold and precious stones lying about.</p>

<p>For three days and nights he lay there; he was fearfully
hungry. And then it dawned upon him that he was to
be starved to death!</p>

<p>He called out, and entreated in vain; nobody answered,
and though he had piles of gold and jewels about him, they
could not purchase him a morsel of food.</p>

<p>He sought in vain for any means of exit. There was a
window, of clearest crystal, but it was barred by a heavy iron
grating. But the window looked into a garden whence he
could hear nightingales singing, doves cooing, and the
murmur of a brook. But inside he saw only heaps of useless
gold and jewels, and his own face, worn and haggard, reflected
a thousand times.</p>

<p>He could now only pray for a speedy death, and took out
a little iron cross, which he had kept by him since his boyhood.
But in doing so he also drew out the gold-embroidered
handkerchief, given him by his wife, and which he had
quite forgotten till now.</p>

<p>Goldmore had been looking on, as he often did, from an
opening in the ceiling to enjoy the sight of his prisoner's
sufferings. All at once he recognized the handkerchief, as
belonging to his own sister, the ferry-man's wife.<span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>He at once changed his treatment of his brother-in-law,
as he had discovered him to be; took him out of prison, led
him to his own apartments, gave him food and drink, and the
Self-playing Guitar into the bargain.</p>

<p>Coming home, the ferry-man met his wife half-way.</p>

<p>"The ball of thread came home alone," she explained;
"so I judged that some misfortune had befallen you, and I
was coming to help you."</p>

<p>He told her all his adventures, and they returned home
together.</p>

<p>The king was all eagerness to see and hear the Self-playing
Guitar; so he ordered the ferry-man, his wife, and
her sister to come with it to the palace at once.</p>

<p>Now the property of this Self-playing Guitar was such
that wherever its music was heard, the sick became well,
those who were sad merry, ugly folks became handsome,
sorceries were dissolved, and those who had been murdered
rose from the dead, and slew their murderers.</p>

<p>So when the king, having been told the charm to set the
guitar playing, said the words, all the court began to be
merry, and dance&mdash;except the king himself!... For all at
once the door opened, the music ceased, and the figure of the
late king stood up in his shroud, and said:</p>

<p>"I was the rightful possessor of the throne! and you,
wicked brother, who caused me to be murdered, shall now
reap your reward!"<span class="pagenum">[67]</span></p>

<p>So saying he breathed upon him, and the king fell dead&mdash;on
which the phantom vanished.</p>

<p>But as soon as they recovered from their fright, all the
nobility who were present acclaimed the ferry-man as their
king.</p>

<p>The next day, after the burial of the late king, the
beautiful sea-maiden, the beloved of the Sun, went back
to the sea, to float about in her silvery canoe, in the company
of the rainbow fishes, and to rejoice in the sunbeams.</p>

<p>But the good ferry-man and his wife lived happily ever
after, as king and queen. And they gave a grand ball to the
nobility and to the people.... The Self-playing Guitar
furnished the music, the wonderful purse scattered gold all
the time, and the king entertained all the guests right
royally.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<h2>THE PRINCESS OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN</h2>

<p class="noin"><img class="dropimg" src="images/drop-t4.jpg" width="159" height="150" alt="T" />
<b>HERE</b> was a young prince, who was not
only most handsome and well-grown, but
also most kind-hearted and good. Now
sooner or later kindness always meets its
reward, though it may not seem so at first.</p>

<p>One summer's evening the prince was walking on the
banks of a lake, when he looked up, and saw to his great
surprise, in the air, against the rosy clouds of the sunset,
three beautiful beings with wings&mdash;not angels, nor birds&mdash;but
three beautiful damsels.</p>

<p>And having alighted on the ground they dropped their
wings and their garments, and left them lying on the shore
and leaped into the cool water, and began splashing and
playing about in it, like so many waterfowl.</p>

<p>As soon as the prince saw this he came out from his<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
hiding-place in the bushes, picked up one pair of wings
and hid himself again.</p>

<p>When they had been long enough in the water, the
beautiful damsels came again to land, and dressed themselves
quickly.</p>

<p>Two of them soon had on both their white dresses and
their wings; but the youngest could not find hers.</p>

<p>They held a short consultation, and the result was, that
the two elder flew away in the shape of birds, as fast as they
could, to fetch another pair of wings for their younger
sister.</p>

<p>They soon vanished in the blue sky; but she remained
alone, wringing her hands, and crying.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for, you lovely maiden?" asked
the prince, emerging from the bushes.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so unhappy!" she replied. "I am a
princess of the Brazen Mountain; my sisters and I
came here to bathe in the lake; and somebody has stolen
my wings; so I must wait here, until they bring me
another pair."</p>

<p>"I am a prince," he replied; "this is my father's kingdom;
be my wife, and I will give you back your wings."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said; "I consent, only you must give
me back my wings at once."</p>

<p>"Let us first go to church, and get married," he answered,
and taking the lovely princess by the hand, he brought her to
<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>his father and mother, and asked their permission to marry
her.</p>

<a name="THE_PRINCE_STEALS_THE_WINGS"></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">THE PRINCE STEALS THE WINGS</p>

<p>The king and queen were delighted with their beautiful
daughter-in-law, gave them their blessing, and all was got
ready for the wedding.</p>

<p>And directly they came back from church the prince,
overcome with joy, kissed his bride, and gave her back her
wings.</p>

<p>She took them joyfully, fastened them to her shoulders;
then flew out of the window, and vanished.</p>

<p>All the wedding-guests were in consternation; the king
looked very serious; the queen wept bitterly; but the prince
so grieved after his bride, that, having obtained his parents'
consent, he went out into the wide world to search for that
Brazen Mountain, where he hoped to find her.</p>

<p>He travelled for a long time, inquiring about it of every
one he met; but nobody had ever heard of such a mountain;
and he began to give up all hope of ever finding it.</p>

<p>Late one evening he saw a twinkling light before him,
which he followed, in the hope of coming to some habitation.
It led him on a long way, across level plains, through deep
defiles, and at length some way into a dark forest. But at
last he came to whence the light proceeded&mdash;from a solitary
hermitage.</p>

<p>He went in; but found the hermit lying dead, with six
wax candles burning around him. He had evidently been<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
dead for some time. Yet there seemed to be nobody near
him, nor any inhabitants at all in this desolate region.</p>

<p>The prince's first thought was how to get him buried,
and with proper rites, when there was no priest&mdash;nor indeed
any people at all&mdash;to be found in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>While he was thinking over this, something fell from a
peg in the wall, close beside him; it was a leather whip.</p>

<p>The prince took it up, and read on the handle these
words:</p>

<p>"The Magic Whip."</p>

<p>As he knew its virtue, he called out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Ho! Magical Whip!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To right and left skip!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And do what I will!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whip jumped from his hand, became invisible, and
flew away.</p>

<p>In a short time there was the hum of a multitude through
the forest; and the head-forester entered, breathless, followed
by a crowd of under-keepers, and many more people with them.</p>

<p>Some set about making a coffin, others began digging
a grave, and the head-keeper rode off to fetch a priest.</p>

<p>And as soon as it was dawn mass was said; the bells
began ringing from several far-distant churches; and at
sunrise the corpse was decently buried. When the funeral
was over all the people dispersed to their homes, and the
Magical Whip returned of itself to the prince's hand.<span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>

<p>He stuck it into his girdle, and went on, till after an hour
or two he came to a clearing in the forest, where twelve men
were fighting desperately among themselves.</p>

<p>"Stop, you fellows!" exclaimed the prince. "Who are
you? and what are you fighting about?"</p>

<p>"We are robbers," they replied, "and we are fighting for
these boots, which were the property of our deceased leader.
Whoever has them can go seven leagues at one step; and he
who gets them will be our leader. As you are a stranger we
will abide by your decision, as to whom this pair of boots
shall belong, and give you a heap of gold into the bargain for
your trouble."</p>

<p>The prince drew on the boots, took the Magical Whip
from his girdle, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Ho! Magical Whip!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To right and left skip!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And do what I will!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whip jumped from his hand, became invisible, and
well thrashed the robbers. In the midst of the confusion
the prince made his escape, and having the boots on he went
seven miles at every step, and was soon far enough away
from the robbers' den.</p>

<p>But as he was no nearer to finding out where the Brazen
Mountain was, he had no need to go quite so fast; so he
took off the seven-league boots, put them under his arm, and
the Magic Whip in his girdle, and went at his ordinary pace,<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
till he came to a narrow path between some rocks, where
again he came upon twelve men fighting.</p>

<p>They explained that they were fighting for an invisible
cap, which had belonged to their late leader; and asked him,
as a stranger, to decide who should have it.</p>

<p>So he set the Magical Whip, as before, to work; and
there was a nice confusion among these robbers, for not
seeing where the blows came from they fell upon one another;
and at last, frightened out of their senses, they took flight,
and scattered in all directions. The prince, having put
on the invisible cap, was able to walk among them, and
talk to them; and they all heard, though they could not
see him.</p>

<p>He now began to consider whether he could not use all
these treasures to help him to find the Brazen Mountain.
So he drew on the seven-league boots, settled the invisible
cap on his forehead, and taking the Magical Whip from his
girdle, said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Oh! thou wondrous Magic Whip!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lead me on; I'll follow thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Onward to the Brazen Mountain<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lead me, where I fain would be!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The whip sprang from his hand. It did not become
invisible this time, but glided rapidly a little above the
ground, like a boat over a calm sea. Though it flew like
a bird, the prince was quite able to keep pace with it, because<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
he had on the seven-league boots. He was scarcely aware of
the fact, when in less than a quarter of an hour they came to a
standstill&mdash;at the Brazen Mountain.</p>

<p>At first the prince was overjoyed at having reached the
goal of his wishes; but when he looked more closely at its
smooth perpendicular sides, hard as adamant&mdash;its summit lost
in the clouds&mdash;he was in despair; for how was he ever to get
to the top of it?</p>

<p>However, he thought there must be some way up after all;
so taking off his boots and cap, he set off to walk round the
base of the mountain.</p>

<p>In half an hour he came to a mill, with twelve millstones.
The miller was an old wizard, with a long beard down to the
ground. He stood beside a stove&mdash;whereupon a kettle was
boiling&mdash;stirring the contents with a long iron spoon, and
piling wood on the fire.</p>

<p>The prince looked into the kettle.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, gaffer. What are you doing
there?"</p>

<p>"That's my own business," replied the miller gruffly.</p>

<p>"What mill is this?" the prince next asked.</p>

<p>"That's no business of yours," replied the miller.</p>

<p>The prince was not going to be satisfied with this; so he
gave his usual orders to the Magical Whip, which forthwith
became invisible, and began to lash the miller soundly. He
tried to run away; but it was no use; till the prince took<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
pity on him, and called the whip back again. He put it up,
and then said:</p>

<p>"Whose mill is this?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to the three princesses of the Brazen
Mountain," replied the miller. "They let down a rope here
every day, and draw up all the flour they want by the rope."</p>

<p>As he said this a thick silken rope came down, with a loop
at the end, which struck the threshold of the mill.</p>

<p>The prince made ready; and when the usual sack of
wheat flour was bound fast in the loop, he climbed upon it,
having first put on his invisible cap, and was thus drawn
up to the top of the Brazen Mountain.</p>

<p>The three princesses, having drawn up their supply of
flour, put it into their storehouse, and went back to their
dwelling.</p>

<p>Their palace was most beautiful, all silver without, and
all gold within. All the windows were of crystal; the chairs
and tables were made of diamonds, and the floors of looking-glass.
The ceilings were like the sky, with mimic stars and
moon shining therein; and in the principal saloon there was
a sun, with rays all round; beautiful birds were singing,
monkeys were telling fairy tales; and in their midst amongst
all this sat three most beautiful princesses.</p>

<p>The two eldest were weaving golden threads in their
looms; but the youngest, the prince's wife, sat silently apart
from her sisters, listening to the murmur of a fountain, her
<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>head leaning on her hand, in deep thought. And as she sat
there two pearly tears coursed down her lovely face.</p>

<p class="caption">THE TRUANT WIFE IS CAPTURED</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, sister?" asked the two elder
princesses.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of the prince, my husband. I love to
think of him, and I am so sorry for him, poor fellow! To
think I left him for no fault at all; and when we loved one
another so dearly! Oh! sisters! I shall have to leave you,
and go back to him; only I fear he will never forgive me,
however I entreat him, for having behaved so unkindly to
him."</p>

<p>"I forgive you, I forgive you everything, darling!" exclaimed
the prince throwing off the invisible cap, and
embracing her rapturously.</p>

<p>Then she gave him wings like her own, and they flew
away together. In an hour or two they arrived in his father's
kingdom.</p>

<p>The king and queen welcomed them joyfully, and all was
greatest joy and happiness henceforward.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<b>HERE</b> was once an old man, who was a
widower, and he had married an old woman,
who was a widow. Both had had children
by their first marriage; and now the old man
had a daughter of his own still living, and the old woman
also had a daughter.</p>

<p>The old man was an honest, hard-working, and good-natured
old fellow, but too much under his wife's thumb.
This was very unfortunate, because she was wicked, cunning,
and sly, and a bad old witch.</p>

<p>Her daughter was only too like her in disposition; but
she was her mother's darling.</p>

<p>But the old man's daughter was a very good sweet girl;<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
nevertheless her stepmother hated her; she was always
tormenting her, and wishing her dead.</p>

<p>One day she had beaten her very cruelly, and pushed her
out of doors; then she said to the old man:</p>

<p>"Your wretched daughter is always giving me trouble;
she is such an ill-tempered, spoilt hussy, that I cannot do
anything with her. So if you wish for peace in the house,
you must put her into your waggon, drive her away into the
forest, and come back without her."</p>

<p>The old man was very sorry to have to do this; for he
loved his own little daughter most dearly. But he was so
afraid of his wife that he dared not refuse; so he put the
poor girl into his waggon, drove a long way into the forest,
took her out, and left her there alone.</p>

<p>She wandered about a long time, gathering wild strawberries,
to eat with a little piece of bread, which her father
had given her. Towards evening she came to the door of a
hut in the forest, and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Nobody answered her knock. So she lifted the latch,
went in, and looked round&mdash;there was nobody there.</p>

<p>But there was a table in one corner, and benches all round
the walls, and an oven by the door. And near the table,
close to the window, was a spinning-wheel, and a quantity
of flax.</p>

<p>The girl sat down to the spinning-wheel, and opened the
window, looked out, and listened; but nobody came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>But as it grew dusk she heard a rustle not far off, and
from somewhere not far from the hut, a voice was heard,
singing:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Wanderer, outcast, forsaken!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whom the night has overtaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If no crime your conscience stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In this hut to-night remain."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the voice ceased, she answered:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"I am outcast and forsaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet unstained by crime am I:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Be you rich, or be you poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For this night here let me lie!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Once more there was a rustle in the branches; the door
opened, and there came into the room&mdash;a bear!</p>

<p>The girl started up, very frightened; but the bear only
said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, pretty maiden!"</p>

<p>"Good evening to you, whoever you are," she replied,
somewhat reassured.</p>

<p>"How did you come here?" he asked. "Was it of your
own free will, or by compulsion?"</p>

<p>The maiden told him all, weeping; but the bear sat
down beside her, and stroking her face with his paw,
replied:</p>

<p>"Do not cry, pretty one; you shall be happy yet.
But in the meantime you must do just what I tell you.
Do you see that flax? You must spin it into thread; of<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
that thread you must weave cloth, and of that cloth you
must make me a shirt. I shall come here to-morrow
at this same time, and if the shirt is ready I will reward
you. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>So saying the bear made her a parting bow, and went out.
At first the girl began to cry, and said to herself:</p>

<p>"How can I do this in only twenty-four hours&mdash;spin all
that flax, weave it into cloth, and make a shirt out of it?
Well! I must set to work! and do what I can.... He
will at least see that my will was good, though I was unable
to perform the task."</p>

<p>Thus saying, she dried her tears, ate some of her bread
and strawberries, sat down to the spinning-wheel, and began
to spin by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>The time went by quickly, as she worked, and it was
daylight before she knew.</p>

<p>And there was no more flax left; she had spun out the
last distaff-full.</p>

<p>She was astonished to see how fast the work had gone,
and began to wonder how she was to weave the thread without
any loom.</p>

<p>Thinking, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>When she woke the sun was already high in the heavens.
There was breakfast ready on the table, and a loom under
the window.</p>

<p>She ran down to the neighbouring brook, washed her<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
face and hands, came back, said grace, and ate her breakfast;
then she sat down to the loom.</p>

<p>The shuttle flew so fast that the cloth was all ready by
noon.</p>

<p>She took it out into a meadow, sprinkled it from the
brook, spread it out in the sun, and in one hour the cloth
was bleached.</p>

<p>She came back with it to the hut, cut out the shirt, and
began to stitch at it diligently.</p>

<p>The twilight was falling, and she was just putting in the
last stitch, when the door opened, and the bear came in, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Is the shirt ready?"</p>

<p>She gave it to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my good girl; now I must reward you.
You told me you had a bad stepmother; if you like, I will
send my bears to tear her and her daughter in pieces."</p>

<p>"Oh! don't do that! I don't want to be revenged; let
them live!"</p>

<p>"Let it be so then! Meanwhile make yourself useful in
the kitchen; get me some porridge for supper. You will find
everything you want in the cupboard in the wall; but I will
go and fetch my bedding, for I shall spend to-night at home."</p>

<p>The bear left the room, and the maiden made up the fire
in the oven, and began to get the porridge ready.</p>

<p>Just then she heard a sound under the bench, and there<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
ran out a poor, lean little mouse, which stood up on its hind-legs,
and said in human tones:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Mistress! help me lest I die<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A poor weak, little mouse am I!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I am hungry, give me food;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And to you will I be good."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The girl was sorry for the mouse, and threw it a spoonful
of porridge.</p>

<p>The mouse ate it, thanked her, and ran away to its
hole.</p>

<p>The bear soon came in, with a load of wood and stones;
these he laid upon the stove, and having eaten a basin of
porridge, he climbed upon the stove, and said:</p>

<p>"Here, girl, is a bunch of keys on a steel ring. Put out
the fire; but you must walk about the room all night, and
keep on jingling these keys, till I get up; and if I find you
alive in the morning you shall be happy."</p>

<p>The bear began snoring directly, and the old man's
daughter kept walking about the hut, jingling the
keys.</p>

<p>Soon the mouse ran out of its hole, and said:</p>

<p>"Give me the keys, mistress, I will jingle them for you;
but you must hide yourself behind the stove, for the stones
will soon be flying about."</p>

<p>So the mouse began to run up and down by the wall,
under the bench. The maiden hid behind the oven, and<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
about midnight the bear woke up, and threw out a stone into
the middle of the room.</p>

<p>But the mouse kept running about, and jingling the keys.
And the bear asked:</p>

<p>"Are you alive?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied the girl, from behind the oven.</p>

<p>The bear began to throw stones and billets of wood, thick
and fast from the stove, and every time he did so, he asked:</p>

<p>"Are you alive?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied the girl's voice from behind the oven;
and the mouse still ran up and down, jingling the keys.</p>

<p>With the dawn the cocks began to crow, but the bear did
not wake. The mouse gave up the keys, and ran back to its
hole; but the old man's daughter began to walk about the
room, and jingled the keys.</p>

<p>At sunrise the bear came off the stove, and said:</p>

<p>"O daughter of the old man! you are blest of heaven!
For here was I, a powerful monarch, changed by enchantment
into a bear, until some living soul should spend two
nights in this hut. And now I shall soon become a man
again, and return to my kingdom, taking you for my wife.
But before this comes to pass, do you look into my right
ear."</p>

<p>The old man's daughter threw back her hair, and looked
into the right ear of the bear. And she saw a beautiful
country, with millions of people, with high mountains, deep
<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>rivers, impenetrable forests, and pastures covered with flocks,
well-to-do villages, and rich cities.</p>

<p>"What seest thou?" asked the bear.</p>

<p>"I see a lovely country."</p>

<p>"That is my kingdom. Look into my left ear."</p>

<p>She looked, and could not enough admire what she saw&mdash;a
magnificent palace, with many carriages and horses in the
courtyard, and in the carriages rich robes, jewels, and all
kinds of rarities.</p>

<p>"What do you see?" asked the bear.</p>

<p>She described it all.</p>

<p>"Which of those carriages do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"The one with four horses," she replied.</p>

<p>"That is yours then," answered the bear, as he opened
the window.</p>

<p>There was a sound of wheels in the forest, and a golden
carriage presently drew up before the cottage drawn by four
splendid horses, although there was no driver.</p>

<p>The bear adorned his beloved with a gown of cloth-of-gold,
with diamond ear-rings, a necklace set with various
precious stones, and diamond rings, saying:</p>

<p>"Wait here a little while; your father will come for you
presently; and in a few days, when the power of the enchantment
is over, and I am a king again, I will come for
you, and you shall be my queen."</p>

<p>So saying the bear disappeared into the forest, and the<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
old man's daughter looked out of the window to watch for her
father's coming.</p>

<p>The old man, having left his daughter in the wood, came
home very sad; but on the third day he harnessed his waggon
again, and drove into the forest, to see if she were alive or
dead; and if she were dead at least to bury her.</p>

<p>Towards evening the old woman and her own daughter
looked out of the window, and a dog, the favourite of the
old man's daughter, suddenly rushed to the door, and began
to bark:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Bow! wow! wow! the old man's here!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bringing home his daughter dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Decked with gold and diamonds' sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Gifts to please a royal queen."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old woman gave the dog an angry kick.
"You lie, you big ugly dog! Bark like this!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Bow! wow! wow! the old man's come!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His daughter's bones he's bringing home!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So saying she opened the door; the dog leaped forth;
and she went with her daughter into the courtyard. They
stood as if transfixed!</p>

<p>For in drove the carriage with four galloping horses, the
old man sitting on the box, cracking his whip, and his
daughter sat inside, dressed in cloth of gold, and adorned
with jewels.</p>

<p>The old woman pretended she was overjoyed to see her,<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
welcomed her with many kisses, and was anxious to know
where she got all these rich and beautiful things.</p>

<p>The girl told her that they were all given to her by the
bear in the forest hut.</p>

<p>Next day the old woman baked some delicious cakes, and
gave them to her own daughter, saying to the old man:</p>

<p>"If your wretched, worthless daughter has had such good
luck, I am sure my sweet, pretty darling will get a deal more
from the bear, if he can only see her. So you must drive her
out in the waggon, leave her in the forest, and come back
without her."</p>

<p>And she gave the old man a good push, to hasten his
departure, shut the door of the cottage in his face, and looked
out of the window to see what would happen.</p>

<p>The old man went to the stable, got out the waggon, put
the horse to, helped his stepdaughter in, and drove away
with her into the forest.</p>

<p>There he left her, turned his horse's head, and drove
quickly home.</p>

<p>The old woman's daughter was not long in finding out
the hut in the forest. Confident in the power of her charms
she went straight into the little room. There was nobody
within; but there was the same table in one corner, the
benches round the walls, the oven by the door, and the
spinning-wheel, under the window, with a great bundle of flax.</p>

<p>She sat down on one of the benches, undid her bundle,<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
and began eating the cakes with great relish, looking from
the window all the time.</p>

<p>It soon began to get dark, a strong wind began to blow,
and a voice was heard singing outside:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Wanderer! outcast, forsaken!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whom the night has overtaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If no crime your conscience stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Here this night you may remain."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the voice ceased she answered:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"I am outcast and forsaken;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet unstained by crime am I:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Be you rich, or be you poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For this night here let me lie."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the door opened, and the bear walked in.</p>

<p>The girl stood up, gave him a winning smile, and waited
for him to bow first.</p>

<p>The bear looked at her narrowly, made a bow, and said:</p>

<p>"Welcome, maiden ... but I have not much time to
stay here. I must go back to the forest; but between now
and to-morrow evening you must make me a shirt, out
of this flax; so you must set at once about spinning,
weaving, bleaching, washing, and then about sewing it.
Good-bye!"</p>

<p>So saying the bear turned, and went out.</p>

<p>"That's not what I came here for," said the girl, so soon
as his back was turned, "to do your spinning, weaving, and
sewing! You may do without a shirt for me!"<span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>So saying, she made herself comfortable on one of the
benches, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Next day, at evening twilight, the bear came back, and
asked:</p>

<p>"Is the shirt ready?"</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>"What's this? the distaff has not been touched."</p>

<p>Silence as before.</p>

<p>"Get me ready my supper at once. You will find water
in that pail, and the groats in that cupboard. I must go and
fetch my bedding, for to-night I will sleep at home."</p>

<p>The bear went out, and the old woman's daughter lit the
fire in the stove, and began to prepare the porridge. Then
the little mouse came out, stood on its hind-legs, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Mistress! help me, or I die!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A poor, weak little mouse am I!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I am hungry, give me food;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And to you will I be good."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the unkind girl only caught up the spoon with which
she was stirring the porridge, and flung it at the poor mouse,
which ran away in a fright.</p>

<p>The bear soon came back with a huge load of stones and
wood; instead of a mattress he arranged a layer of stones on
the top of the stove, and covered this with the wood, in place
of a sheet. He ate up the porridge, and said:</p>

<p>"Here! take these keys; walk all night about the hut,<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
and keep on jingling them. And if, when I get up to-morrow,
I find you still alive, you shall be happy."</p>

<p>The bear was snoring at once, and the old woman's
daughter walked up and down drowsily, jingling the
keys.</p>

<p>But about midnight the bear woke up, and flung a stone
towards the quarter whence he heard the jingling. It hit
the old woman's daughter.</p>

<p>She gave one shriek, fell, and expired instantly.</p>

<p>Next morning the bear descended from the top of the
oven, looked once at the dead girl, opened the cottage door,
stood upon the threshold, and stamped upon it three times
with all his force. It thundered and lightened; and in one
moment the bear became a handsome young king, with a
golden sceptre in his hand, and a diamond crown on his
head.</p>

<p>And now there drew up before the cottage a carriage,
bright as sunshine, with six horses. The coachman cracked
his whip, till the leaves fell from the trees, and the king got
into the carriage, and drove away from the forest to his own
capital city.</p>

<p>The old man having left his stepdaughter in the forest
came home rejoicing in his daughter's joy. She was expecting
the king every day. In the meantime he busied himself
with looking after the four splendid horses, cleaning the
golden carriage, and airing the costly horse-clothes.<span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>On the third day after his return the old woman came
down upon him and said:</p>

<p>"Go and fetch my darling; she is no doubt all dressed in
gold by this time, or married to a king; so I shall be a
queen's mother."</p>

<p>The old man, obedient as ever, harnessed the waggon,
and drove off.</p>

<p>When evening came the old woman gazed from the
window; when the dog began to bark:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Bow! wow! wow! the old man's come!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Your daughter's bones he's bringing home!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>"You lie!" exclaimed the old woman; "bark like this:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Bow! wow! wow! the old man's here!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Driving home your daughter dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Decked in gold and diamonds' sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Gifts to please a royal queen.'"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So saying she ran out of the house to meet the old man,
coming back in the waggon; but she stood as if thunderstruck,
sobbed, and wept, and was hardly able to articulate:</p>

<p>"Where is my sweetest daughter?"</p>

<p>The old man scratched his head, and replied:</p>

<p>"She has met with a great misfortune; this is all I have
found of her&mdash;a few bare bones, and blood-stained garments;
in the wood, in the old hut ... she has been devoured by
wolves."</p>

<p>The old woman, wild with grief and despair, gathered up
<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>her daughter's bones, went to some neighbouring cross-ways,
and when a number of people had gathered together, she
buried them there with weeping and lamentation; then she
fell face downward on the grave&mdash;and was turned to stone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a royal carriage drew up in the courtyard of
the old man's cottage, bright as the sun, with four splendid
horses, and the coachman cracked his whip&mdash;till the cottage
fell to pieces with the sound.</p>

<p>The king took both the old man and his daughter into the
carriage, and they drove away to his capital, where the
marriage soon took place.</p>

<p>The old man lived happily in his declining years, as
the father-in-law of a king, and with his sweet daughter,
who had once been so miserable, a queen.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="h3">NOTE I</p>

<p class="h3">THE FROG PRINCESS</p>

<p>This is certainly a "Nature story." The princess and
her attendants are clearly personification of the elemental
forces. The classical scholar cannot fail to be struck by
the likeness of her metamorphoses to the story of Peleus
and Thetis. Indeed the "Protean myth" so repeatedly
occurs in these primitive Slavonic stories that it is impossible
not to suspect a common origin.</p>

<p class="h3">NOTE II</p>

<p class="h3">PRINCESS MIRANDA AND PRINCE HERO</p>

<p>The old woman "Jandza"&mdash;which word Polish dictionary-makers
translate by "fury"&mdash;appears very often both in
Polish and Russian fairy tales, as a witch of witches. She is
sometimes "Jaga"; and seems pretty malevolent, though
capable of serving those who know how to manage her.</p>

<p>This story&mdash;probably a symbolic one&mdash;of the Spring and
Winter, or the triumph of Light over Darkness, might be read
at the present moment into an allegory of Poland, overrun,
her people oppressed, starved, and all but extirpated by the
malignant spirit of German militarism. Princess Miranda,
herself unsleeping, awake, and watching, while all is
desolation and despair around her, might be taken for the<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
Spirit of Poland herself, undying, but waiting for deliverance.
But where is the Prince Hero, who shall deliver her?</p>

<p><i>Princess Miranda</i>&mdash;her name is <i>cud-dziewica</i>, i.e.
"Wonder Maiden"&mdash;but is not "admired Miranda" the
most obvious rendering?</p>

<p class="h3">NOTE III</p>

<p class="h3">THE WHIRLWIND</p>

<p>The name of the heroine "Ladna" signifies "pretty"
or "beautiful" in Polish. It is not the word originally
used; but being nearly equivalent, and of similar meaning,
appears preferable.</p>

<p>The prince's name "Dobrotek," signifies "good," or
"benefactor." Being easy of pronunciation, but not easily
Englished into a proper name, it seemed best to retain it.</p>

<p>The whole story has a very Eastern cast. The mention
of the "Seven seas," and the high mountains beyond them,
suggest Persian or Indian influence. The ugly dwarf, with
the long beard and diminutive stature, seems a malignant
"Jinn," and to have his counterpart in a well-known legend
of the Arabian Nights. But this is not the only Polish tale
that gives this impression; more than one appears directly
taken from these tales.</p>

<p>P. 50. "The Water of Loosening." Loosening is not
perhaps an exact rendering, which is rather "unstiffening,"
or destroying the <i>rigor mortis</i>, as a preparative to healing<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
a mortal wound, and breaking the sleep of death. These
three waters always appear in stories, where this incident
is used.</p>

<p class="h3">NOTE IV</p>

<p class="h3">THE PRINCESS OF THE BRAZEN MOUNTAIN</p>

<p>This story is rather freely translated, and much shortened
from the original. There is much pious reflection, too long
for insertion. The conversation between the prince and the
sorcerer-miller is somewhat changed as much of it seemed
rather irrelevant to the chief interest of the story, and lacking
in pithiness.</p>

<p>The story of a supernatural maiden, compelled by the
theft of her wings to remain temporarily as a mortal with a
mortal husband, has its counterpart in many lands. The
oldest perhaps is a Persian story, related in Keightly's
"Fairy Mythology," of a Peri, who being thus entrapped,
lives several years as an ordinary woman; but accidently
finding her wings again, puts them on, and deserts her mortal
husband and children, remarking as she does so: "I loved
you well enough, while we remained together; but I love my
former husband better"&mdash;and so vanishes away to Peristan.</p>

<p>The parallel legend of "Little Sealskin" will readily
occur to memory.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
